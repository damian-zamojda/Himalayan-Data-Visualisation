# Summary and bibliography

The data collection as an impressive collection of Himalayan expeditions from many decades is a fascinating documentary output. The stories behind the numbers are evidence of the amazing possibilities of mankind and it will never be possible to show everything on the charts alone. As an exercise and a mine of knowledge for Data Scientist, it is a first-class treat.

The data was collected via the project tidytuesday:
